# Notification Failures

## Meaning
Alertmanager is failing to send notifications to configured receivers (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).

## Impact
Critical alerts may not be delivered to the intended recipients, potentially leading to delayed incident response.

## Diagnosis
1. Check Alertmanager logs for error messages:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=alertmanager
```

2. Verify receiver configurations:
```bash
kubectl get secret alertmanager-config -o yaml
```

3. Test network connectivity to notification services:
```bash
nc -zv slack.com 443
```

## Mitigation
1. Fix any configuration errors in the alertmanager.yml
2. Ensure all credentials and tokens are valid and properly configured
3. Verify network policies allow outbound connections to notification services
4. Consider implementing backup notification channels
