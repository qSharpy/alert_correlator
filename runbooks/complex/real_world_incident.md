# Real-World Complex Incident

## Meaning
A complex, multi-faceted incident affecting multiple systems simultaneously, often with cascading failures and unclear root causes, similar to major production outages experienced in real-world scenarios.

## Impact
- Widespread service disruption affecting multiple user-facing systems
- Significant customer impact with potential revenue loss
- Multiple teams involved in incident response
- Complex troubleshooting due to interrelated failures
- Extended time to resolution due to complexity
- Potential reputation damage if customer-facing services are affected

## Diagnosis
1. Establish an incident command structure:
```bash
# Designate incident commander, communications lead, and technical leads
# Set up dedicated communication channels
```

2. Create a timeline of events:
```bash
# Document when each alert fired
# Map dependencies between affected systems
```

3. Identify the most critical customer-impacting issues:
```bash
# Prioritize user-facing and revenue-generating services
# Quantify impact (users affected, error rates, etc.)
```

4. Look for common patterns across failures:
```bash
# Check for shared infrastructure dependencies
# Look for recent changes that might have triggered the incident
```

5. Divide and conquer for investigation:
```bash
# Assign specific components to different teams
# Establish regular sync points to share findings
```

## Mitigation
1. Immediate actions:
   - Implement emergency traffic management:
   ```bash
   # Route traffic away from affected systems
   # Enable circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   ```
   
   - Restore critical services first:
   ```bash
   # Focus on user-facing and revenue-generating services
   # Consider rolling back recent changes across multiple systems
   ```
   
   - Scale up resources where needed:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment/<critical-service> --replicas=<increased-number> -n <namespace>
   ```
   
   - Communicate status to customers:
   ```bash
   # Update status page
   # Prepare customer communications
   ```

2. Short-term fixes:
   - Stabilize the system before attempting full recovery:
   ```bash
   # Address immediate resource constraints
   # Implement temporary workarounds for critical functions
   ```
   
   - Restore services in the correct dependency order:
   ```bash
   # Start with foundational services and work upward
   ```
   
   - Implement degraded modes where necessary:
   ```bash
   # Enable feature flags to disable non-critical functionality
   ```
   
   - Monitor closely for secondary issues:
   ```bash
   # Watch for new alerts or anomalies during recovery
   ```

3. Long-term solutions:
   - Conduct a thorough post-incident review:
     - Document the incident timeline
     - Identify root causes and contributing factors
     - Develop action items to prevent recurrence
   
   - Improve system resilience:
     - Implement better isolation between components
     - Design for graceful degradation
     - Add redundancy for critical components
   
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting:
     - Add early warning indicators
     - Improve correlation between related alerts
     - Create dashboards for complex failure scenarios
   
   - Improve incident response:
     - Develop playbooks for complex scenarios
     - Conduct regular disaster recovery drills
     - Train teams on incident management for complex outages
