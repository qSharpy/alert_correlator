# API Gateway Failures

## Meaning
The API gateway is experiencing issues that are affecting multiple downstream services, such as high error rates, throttling, or performance degradation.

## Impact
- Multiple downstream services affected simultaneously
- Potential complete outage of API-dependent applications
- Degraded user experience across multiple features
- Increased load on remaining healthy gateway instances
- Potential security implications if gateway authentication is affected

## Diagnosis
1. Check API gateway status and metrics:
```bash
# Review gateway metrics in monitoring dashboard
# Check for error rates, latency, and request volume
```

2. Verify gateway instance health:
```bash
# For Kubernetes-based gateways
kubectl get pods -l app=api-gateway -n <namespace>
kubectl describe pods -l app=api-gateway -n <namespace>
```

3. Check gateway logs for errors:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=api-gateway -n <namespace> | grep -i "error\|exception\|failed"
```

4. Verify downstream service health:
```bash
# Check health of services behind the gateway
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```

5. Test gateway endpoints directly:
```bash
# Test key endpoints to verify functionality
curl -v https://<gateway-url>/health
```

## Mitigation
1. Immediate actions:
   - Restart unhealthy gateway instances:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/api-gateway -n <namespace>
   ```
   
   - Scale up gateway instances to handle load:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment/api-gateway --replicas=<increased-number> -n <namespace>
   ```
   
   - Implement emergency rate limiting if necessary:
   ```bash
   # Update gateway configuration to limit incoming requests
   ```
   
   - If a recent deployment caused the issue, roll back:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-gateway -n <namespace>
   ```

2. Short-term fixes:
   - Bypass the gateway for critical services if possible:
   ```bash
   # Update DNS or load balancer to route traffic directly
   ```
   
   - Adjust timeout and retry settings:
   ```bash
   # Update gateway configuration with appropriate values
   ```
   
   - Implement or adjust circuit breakers:
   ```bash
   # Configure circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   ```

3. Long-term solutions:
   - Improve gateway architecture:
     - Implement proper redundancy and failover
     - Consider multi-region deployment
     - Implement proper load testing and capacity planning
   
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting:
     - Add detailed metrics for gateway components
     - Implement synthetic monitoring for key paths
     - Create dashboards showing gateway and downstream service correlation
   
   - Improve deployment practices:
     - Implement canary deployments for gateway changes
     - Create automated rollback mechanisms
     - Develop comprehensive pre-deployment testing
   
   - Review and optimize gateway configuration:
     - Tune connection pools and thread settings
     - Implement proper caching strategies
     - Review and optimize routing rules
