# Mixed Severity Alerts

## Meaning
Multiple related alerts with different severity levels are triggering for the same underlying issue, indicating a problem that is progressively worsening or has varying impacts across different components.

## Impact
- Confusion about the true severity of the incident
- Difficulty in prioritizing response actions
- Risk of focusing on symptoms rather than root causes
- Potential for both under-reaction and over-reaction to the situation
- Challenges in communicating incident status to stakeholders

## Diagnosis
1. Establish a timeline of alerts:
```bash
# Review alert history to understand progression
# Note the sequence of severity escalation
```

2. Identify relationships between alerts:
```bash
# Look for common components, services, or resources
# Check for parent-child relationships between alerts
```

3. Determine the highest impact alerts:
```bash
# Focus on critical alerts affecting user-facing services
# Identify alerts with direct business impact
```

4. Correlate with system metrics:
```bash
# Review relevant metrics in monitoring dashboards
# Look for gradual degradation patterns
```

5. Check for incident identifiers:
```bash
# Look for common incident IDs or correlation tags
# Check if alerts are part of a known incident
```

## Mitigation
1. Immediate actions:
   - Address the highest severity alerts first:
   ```bash
   # Prioritize critical alerts affecting user experience
   ```
   
   - Establish a clear incident severity level:
   ```bash
   # Declare an incident with appropriate severity based on impact
   # Document the incident in your incident management system
   ```
   
   - Communicate the consolidated status to stakeholders:
   ```bash
   # Provide a single, clear message about the incident
   ```

2. Short-term fixes:
   - Implement a unified response plan:
   ```bash
   # Create a coordinated action plan addressing all alert levels
   ```
   
   - Address the root cause rather than individual symptoms:
   ```bash
   # Focus remediation efforts on the underlying issue
   ```
   
   - Monitor for alert resolution in the reverse order of appearance:
   ```bash
   # Lower severity alerts should resolve first if addressing root cause
   ```

3. Long-term solutions:
   - Improve alert correlation:
     - Implement alert grouping by incident
     - Add causal relationships between alerts
     - Use common incident identifiers across alerts
   
   - Enhance alert design:
     - Create multi-level alert thresholds with clear progression
     - Implement predictive alerting for early warning
     - Design alerts to clearly indicate primary vs. secondary issues
   
   - Refine incident response procedures:
     - Develop playbooks for common multi-alert scenarios
     - Train teams on holistic incident response
     - Implement post-incident reviews that consider alert quality
   
   - Improve monitoring:
     - Create dashboards showing related metrics across severity levels
     - Implement anomaly detection for early warning
     - Add business context to technical alerts
