# API High Latency

## Meaning
The API service is experiencing response times that exceed the defined threshold, indicating performance degradation.

## Impact
- Slow user experience and increased page load times
- Timeout errors for clients with strict timeout settings
- Increased resource consumption due to longer-running requests
- Potential cascading performance issues to dependent services

## Diagnosis
1. Check API service response time metrics:
```bash
# Review latency metrics in Grafana dashboard
```

2. Analyze API service resource usage:
```bash
kubectl top pod -l app=<service-name> -n <namespace>
```

3. Check database query performance:
```bash
# Review slow query logs or database monitoring
```

4. Examine network latency between services:
```bash
# Use network monitoring tools or service mesh telemetry
```

5. Review recent traffic patterns for unusual spikes:
```bash
# Check traffic monitoring dashboards
```

## Mitigation
1. Scale up the service horizontally if under high load:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment/<service-name> --replicas=<increased-number> -n <namespace>
```

2. Optimize database queries:
   - Add appropriate indexes
   - Review and optimize complex queries
   - Consider caching frequently accessed data

3. Implement or adjust caching strategies:
   - Add Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed data
   - Implement HTTP caching headers

4. Review and optimize code:
   - Look for N+1 query patterns
   - Check for synchronous operations that could be made asynchronous
   - Identify and fix memory leaks

5. Consider implementing circuit breakers for slow dependencies

6. If the issue persists, consider temporarily increasing the latency threshold while implementing long-term fixes
