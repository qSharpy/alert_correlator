# API High Error Rate

## Meaning
The API service is experiencing a high percentage of errors when processing requests, exceeding the defined threshold.

## Impact
- Degraded user experience with failed API requests
- Potential data loss or incomplete transactions
- Increased load on dependent systems due to retry attempts
- Customer dissatisfaction and potential revenue impact

## Diagnosis
1. Check API service logs for error patterns:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=<service-name> -n <namespace> | grep ERROR
```

2. Verify API endpoint health and response codes:
```bash
curl -I https://<api-endpoint>/health
```

3. Check dependent service availability:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```

4. Monitor error rate metrics in Grafana:
```bash
# Navigate to API monitoring dashboard
```

5. Check recent deployments or configuration changes:
```bash
kubectl describe deployment <service-name> -n <namespace>
```

## Mitigation
1. If a recent deployment caused the issue, consider rolling back:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<service-name> -n <namespace>
```

2. Scale up the service if it's under load:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment/<service-name> --replicas=<increased-number> -n <namespace>
```

3. Check and fix any database connection issues
4. Verify network connectivity to dependent services
5. Implement circuit breakers if dependent services are failing
6. Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors
