# API Circuit Breaker Open

## Meaning
A circuit breaker for a specific service dependency has tripped open due to a high failure rate, indicating persistent issues with a downstream service.

## Impact
- Requests to the affected downstream service are failing fast or using fallback mechanisms
- Degraded functionality for features dependent on the affected service
- Potential user experience impact depending on the criticality of the affected service
- Protection of the system from cascading failures

## Diagnosis
1. Identify which downstream service is affected:
```bash
# Check circuit breaker metrics in monitoring dashboard
```

2. Verify the status of the downstream service:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=<downstream-service> -n <namespace>
```

3. Check logs of the downstream service for errors:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=<downstream-service> -n <namespace> | grep -i "error\|exception\|failed"
```

4. Review recent changes to the downstream service:
```bash
kubectl describe deployment <downstream-service> -n <namespace>
```

5. Check network connectivity between services:
```bash
# Use network diagnostic tools or service mesh telemetry
```

## Mitigation
1. Address issues with the downstream service:
   - Fix any bugs or configuration issues
   - Scale the service if it's under high load
   - Restart the service if it's in an inconsistent state

2. If the downstream service cannot be fixed immediately:
   - Implement or improve fallback mechanisms
   - Consider feature toggles to disable affected functionality
   - Communicate impact to users if necessary

3. Once the downstream service is stable, manually reset the circuit breaker if needed:
```bash
# This depends on your circuit breaker implementation
# For example, with Hystrix Dashboard or similar tools
```

4. Monitor the service after resetting the circuit breaker to ensure stability

5. Long-term improvements:
   - Improve resilience patterns (retries, timeouts, bulkheads)
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting for early detection
   - Consider implementing chaos engineering to test failure scenarios
   - Review and adjust circuit breaker thresholds based on service behavior
