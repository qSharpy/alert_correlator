# API High CPU Usage

## Meaning
The API service is consuming CPU resources at a rate that exceeds the defined threshold, indicating potential performance issues or inefficient code execution.

## Impact
- Degraded service performance and increased response times
- Potential service throttling by the container orchestrator
- Risk of service instability or crashes under sustained high load
- Increased operational costs due to inefficient resource utilization

## Diagnosis
1. Check current CPU usage across service instances:
```bash
kubectl top pod -l app=<service-name> -n <namespace>
```

2. Review historical CPU metrics to identify patterns:
```bash
# Check CPU usage graphs in monitoring dashboard
```

3. Analyze application profiling data if available:
```bash
# Review CPU profiling data from APM tools
```

4. Check for recent code deployments or configuration changes:
```bash
kubectl describe deployment <service-name> -n <namespace>
```

5. Examine service logs for unusual activity:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=<service-name> -n <namespace> | grep -i "error\|exception\|warning"
```

## Mitigation
1. Scale the service horizontally to distribute load:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment/<service-name> --replicas=<increased-number> -n <namespace>
```

2. Increase CPU limits temporarily if needed:
```bash
kubectl patch deployment <service-name> -n <namespace> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"<container-name>","resources":{"limits":{"cpu":"<increased-limit>"}}}]}}}}'
```

3. Implement or adjust caching strategies to reduce computational load

4. Optimize code execution:
   - Identify and fix CPU-intensive operations
   - Consider asynchronous processing for heavy computations
   - Implement more efficient algorithms for critical paths

5. If the issue is related to a specific request pattern:
   - Implement rate limiting for expensive operations
   - Consider throttling or queuing mechanisms

6. For long-term solutions:
   - Conduct thorough code profiling to identify bottlenecks
   - Consider refactoring CPU-intensive components
   - Evaluate microservice boundaries to better distribute computational load
