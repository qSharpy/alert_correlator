# Network Latency High

## Meaning
Network communication between specific zones or services is experiencing higher than normal latency, exceeding defined thresholds.

## Impact
- Increased API response times and service latency
- Degraded user experience for latency-sensitive operations
- Potential timeouts for services with strict timeout settings
- Reduced throughput for data-intensive operations
- Possible cascading performance issues across the service mesh

## Diagnosis
1. Measure current latency between affected zones:
```bash
# Using ping to measure basic latency
ping -c 20 <destination-ip>

# Using traceroute to identify slow network hops
traceroute <destination-ip>

# Using specialized tools for more detailed analysis
mtr <destination-ip>
```

2. Check for network congestion:
```bash
# Review network throughput and utilization metrics in monitoring dashboard
```

3. Verify if the issue is isolated to specific routes:
```bash
# Test latency to multiple destinations to isolate the problem
```

4. Check for recent network changes:
```bash
# Review network configuration changes, routing updates, etc.
```

5. Monitor service mesh telemetry if available:
```bash
# Check service mesh dashboards for latency metrics
```

## Mitigation
1. Immediate actions:
   - Reroute traffic if alternative paths are available:
   ```bash
   # Update routing tables or load balancer configurations
   ```
   
   - Reduce non-essential traffic if network is congested:
   ```bash
   # Temporarily disable or throttle non-critical services
   ```
   
   - Increase timeouts for critical services to prevent failures:
   ```bash
   # Update service configurations to increase timeout values
   ```

2. Short-term fixes:
   - Optimize data transfer patterns:
     - Reduce payload sizes
     - Implement compression
     - Batch small requests
   
   - Adjust retry strategies to prevent retry storms:
   ```bash
   # Update retry configurations with exponential backoff
   ```
   
   - Implement or adjust circuit breakers for affected routes

3. Long-term solutions:
   - Improve network infrastructure:
     - Upgrade network hardware
     - Optimize routing
     - Implement QoS (Quality of Service)
   
   - Consider architectural changes:
     - Move related services closer together
     - Implement data locality
     - Use CDNs for content delivery
   
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting:
     - Set up continuous latency monitoring
     - Implement predictive alerting
     - Create network topology maps
   
   - Review and optimize cross-zone communication patterns
