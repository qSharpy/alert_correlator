# DNS Resolution Failures

## Meaning
DNS queries are failing at an abnormal rate, preventing services from resolving hostnames to IP addresses.

## Impact
- Services unable to connect to dependencies using hostnames
- API calls failing due to inability to resolve endpoints
- Service discovery mechanisms breaking down
- Potential complete outage of services that rely on DNS for connectivity

## Diagnosis
1. Check DNS server status:
```bash
# Test DNS resolution
dig <domain-name> @<dns-server-ip>

# Check DNS server health
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns  # For Kubernetes clusters
```

2. Verify network connectivity to DNS servers:
```bash
ping <dns-server-ip>
traceroute <dns-server-ip>
```

3. Check for DNS query errors in service logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=<service-name> -n <namespace> | grep -i "dns\|resolve\|lookup"
```

4. Test resolution of specific domains:
```bash
nslookup <problematic-domain> <dns-server-ip>
```

5. Check DNS metrics:
```bash
# Review DNS metrics in monitoring dashboard
```

## Mitigation
1. Immediate actions:
   - Restart DNS servers if they appear to be malfunctioning:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/coredns -n kube-system  # For Kubernetes with CoreDNS
   ```
   
   - Switch to alternative DNS servers temporarily:
   ```bash
   # Update resolv.conf or DNS configuration
   ```
   
   - If using service mesh, check and restart DNS components

2. Short-term fixes:
   - Increase DNS cache TTL to reduce query load:
   ```bash
   # Update DNS server configuration
   ```
   
   - Scale up DNS servers if under high load:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment/coredns --replicas=<increased-number> -n kube-system  # For Kubernetes with CoreDNS
   ```
   
   - Update /etc/hosts or equivalent with critical hostnames as a temporary workaround

3. Long-term solutions:
   - Implement DNS monitoring and alerting
   
   - Consider redundant DNS servers across different providers
   
   - Implement local DNS caching
   
   - Review DNS architecture for single points of failure
   
   - Consider implementing service mesh for improved service discovery
   
   - Optimize DNS TTL values based on change frequency
   
   - Implement proper DNS record management and automation
