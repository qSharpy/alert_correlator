# Database Replication Lag

## Meaning
A database replica is falling behind the primary database in applying changes, resulting in stale data being served from the replica.

## Impact
- Stale or inconsistent data served to users from read replicas
- Potential data inconsistency across services using different replicas
- Risk of data loss if primary fails and needs to fail over to an outdated replica
- Degraded read performance if applications retry or fall back to the primary

## Diagnosis
1. Check current replication lag:
```bash
# For PostgreSQL
psql -h <replica-host> -U <user> -d <database> -c "SELECT now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp() AS replication_lag;"

# For MySQL
mysql -h <replica-host> -u <user> -p<password> -e "SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G" | grep "Seconds_Behind_Master"
```

2. Monitor replication lag trends:
```bash
# Check replication lag metrics in monitoring dashboard
```

3. Check for long-running transactions on the primary:
```bash
# For PostgreSQL
psql -h <primary-host> -U <user> -d <database> -c "SELECT pid, now() - xact_start AS xact_runtime, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE xact_start IS NOT NULL ORDER BY xact_runtime DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

4. Examine replica resource utilization:
```bash
# Check CPU, memory, disk I/O in monitoring dashboard
```

5. Check network connectivity between primary and replica:
```bash
# Network monitoring tools or ping tests
```

## Mitigation
1. Immediate actions:
   - If caused by long-running transactions, consider terminating them:
   ```bash
   # For PostgreSQL
   psql -h <primary-host> -U <user> -d <database> -c "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<pid>);"
   ```
   
   - Temporarily direct read traffic to other replicas or primary if available

2. Short-term fixes:
   - Increase resources for the lagging replica:
   ```bash
   # If using cloud-managed database, scale up the replica
   # If self-managed, add resources to the VM/container
   ```
   
   - Reduce load on the replica by redirecting some read traffic

3. Long-term solutions:
   - Optimize write patterns on the primary:
     - Avoid large transactions
     - Batch smaller writes together
     - Implement proper indexing
   
   - Improve replica hardware or configuration:
     - Faster disks (SSD/NVMe)
     - More CPU/memory
     - Optimize database configuration for replication
   
   - Consider architectural changes:
     - Implement read-write splitting with awareness of replication lag
     - Use sharding to distribute write load
     - Implement eventual consistency patterns in application code
   
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting for early detection
