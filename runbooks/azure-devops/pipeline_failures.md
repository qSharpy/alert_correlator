# Pipeline Failures

## Meaning
Multiple pipeline failures detected across projects, indicating systematic issues rather than individual build failures.

## Impact
- Delayed deployments and releases
- Blocked development work
- Potential production fixes delayed
- Team productivity affected

## Diagnosis
1. Check Azure DevOps service health:
```bash
# Visit Azure DevOps Service Health Dashboard
https://status.dev.azure.com
```

2. Review pipeline logs:
- Navigate to the failed pipeline
- Check error messages in logs
- Review system diagnostics
- Examine any infrastructure-related errors

3. Check agent status:
```bash
# Via Azure DevOps UI:
Project Settings > Agent Pools > View agents
```

4. Review recent changes:
- Pipeline definition changes
- Infrastructure changes
- Dependencies updates

## Mitigation
1. If service-related:
   - Monitor Azure DevOps status page
   - Contact Azure support if necessary
   
2. If infrastructure-related:
   - Check agent pool health
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Review resource utilization

3. If code-related:
   - Revert recent changes if identified
   - Update dependencies if needed
   - Fix pipeline configuration issues

4. Long-term prevention:
   - Implement pipeline monitoring
   - Set up automated notifications
   - Regular agent maintenance
   - Keep dependencies updated
