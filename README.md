# üö® Alert Fatigue No More: Building an AI-Powered Correlation Engine for Prometheus

A powerful alert correlation system that helps reduce alert fatigue by intelligently grouping and analyzing related alerts from your monitoring stack. Built with Prometheus, AlertManager, Grafana, and Loki.

## üåü Features

- Intelligent alert correlation and grouping
- Real-time alert processing
- Beautiful Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Integrated logging with Loki
- Comprehensive runbooks for common scenarios
- Docker-based deployment for easy setup

## üé• Demo

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:
- `backend/`: Contains the core application logic
  - `alert_correlator.py`: Main correlation engine
  - `server.js`: API server
- `config/`: Configuration files for monitoring and logging
  - `logging/`: Loki and Promtail configurations
  - `monitoring/`: Prometheus and AlertManager configurations
- `docker/`: Docker-related files
  - `Dockerfile`: Main application container
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Service orchestration
  - `.env`: Environment variables
- `frontend/`: Web interface files
- `grafana/`: Grafana provisioning and dashboards
- `runbooks/`: Documentation for various scenarios
- `logs/`: Application logs

## üîß Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Python 3.8 or higher (if running locally)
- ~2GB of free RAM for all containers

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alert_correlator.git
cd alert_correlator
```

2. Set up environment configuration:

Create or modify the `.env` file in the `docker` directory with your OpenAI API key:
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > docker/.env
```

3. Create the logs directory and log file:
```bash
mkdir -p logs
touch logs/alert_correlator.log
```

4. Start the services:
```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## üìä Accessing the Services

After starting the containers, you can access the following services:

- Grafana: http://localhost:3000
  - Default credentials: admin/admin
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- AlertManager: http://localhost:9093
- Alert Correlator API: http://localhost:5000
- Loki: http://localhost:3100

## üìà Grafana Dashboard

1. Login to Grafana at http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to Dashboards -> Browse
3. Look for "Alert Correlator Dashboard"
4. The dashboard includes:
   - Alert correlation statistics
   - Active alert groups
   - Historical correlation data
   - Alert patterns and trends

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Alert Correlator

The main configuration is done through environment variables and the following files:
- `backend/alert_correlator.py`: Main correlation logic
- `config/monitoring/alertmanager.yml`: AlertManager configuration
- `config/monitoring/prometheus.yml`: Prometheus configuration
- `config/logging/loki-config.yaml`: Loki configuration
- `config/logging/promtail-config.yaml`: Log shipping configuration

### Runbooks

Predefined runbooks are available in the `runbooks/` directory, organized by component:
- `alertmanager/`: AlertManager related issues
- `prometheus/`: Prometheus troubleshooting
- `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes cluster issues
- `grafana/`: Grafana-related problems
- `azure-devops/`: Azure DevOps pipeline issues

## üîç Testing

You can test the alert correlation system using the Makefile:

```bash
make help
```

## üìù Logging

Logs are available in:
- Docker logs: `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f [service_name]`
- Application logs: `logs/alert_correlator.log`
- Through Loki in Grafana
